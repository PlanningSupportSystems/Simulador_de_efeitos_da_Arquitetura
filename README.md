# Simulador de efeitos da Arquitetura

This project aims to simulate the architectural effects on urban vitality. The tool integrates Unreal Engine and Esri's CityEngine plugin to create a dynamic simulation environment for urban design analysis.

Key Features:
Lot Creation from Splines: The tool generates urban lots by defining splines, which are then processed using Esri's CityEngine plugin to apply CGA (Computer Generated Architecture) rules for the creation of urban elements.

Urban Scenario Generation: CGA rules are utilized to model buildings, streets, and other urban structures, enabling the simulation of diverse architectural scenarios.

Simulation of Pedestrian Dynamics: Using the relationships established in the research, pedestrians are spawned and their behaviors are simulated within the urban environment. This allows for the study of human interactions and movement patterns influenced by architectural design.

Vitality Analysis: The simulation assesses how different architectural configurations impact the vitality and social dynamics of the urban scene, providing insights into the relationship between design and urban liveliness.

By combining urban planning, architectural research, and advanced simulation technologies, this project serves as a powerful tool for architects, urban planners, and researchers. It enables the visualization and analysis of how design decisions shape the vibrancy and functionality of urban spaces.
